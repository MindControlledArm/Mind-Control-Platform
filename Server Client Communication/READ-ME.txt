This library contains java code for a server-client communication over TCP.
It can be use on various platforms for differnet purposes. 

It was originaly created to enable commuunction between a PC application 
(Processing  the EEG signals) to an android app (that has 
the ability to control the motors using an arduino board).
The PC app can transperntly invoke commands that will operate the 
motors.

It has three parts 

- Server
- client
- Commands interface

The server (The android app) must implement the interface and translate each 
coomand to a movement of the motors, as guranteed to the client, 
which will invoke the commands depending on the data it reads from the EEG.
