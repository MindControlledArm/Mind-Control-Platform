This library contains java code for a server-client communication over TCP.
It can be use on various platforms for different purposes. 

It was originally created to enable communication between a PC application 
(Processing  the EEG signals) to an android app (that has 
the ability to control the motors using an Arduino board).
The PC app can transparently invoke commands that will operate the 
motors.

It has three parts 

- Server
- client
- Commands interface

The server (The android app) must implement the interface and translate each 
command to a movement of the motors, as guaranteed to the client, 
which will invoke the commands depending on the data it reads from the EEG.
